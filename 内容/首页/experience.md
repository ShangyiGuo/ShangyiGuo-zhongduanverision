  - title: Controllable synthesis and performance test of high-mobility III-V nanowires
    company: Instructed by: Professor. Zai-xing Yang
    company_url: ''
    company_logo: 
    location: Shandong University, China
    date_start: '2021-09-13'
    date_end: ''
    description: |2-
        Responsibilities include:
        
        * Synthesized n-channel nanowires (InP) with high electron mobility and p-channel nanowires (GaSb) with high hole mobility by controllable vapor-solid-solid growth mode of CVD.
        * Studied in electrical and photoelectric properties of III-V nanowires (GaSb, InP) by using Semiconductor Device Analyzer and probe station.
        * Read masses of papers with regard to the III-V nanowires and participated weekly group meetings.
        * Working on the project now with Postdoc and PhD students.
        
  - title: Design & development of a multifunctional passive filter for test circuits of 2D systems
    company: Instructed by: Professor. Zhe Wang
    company_url: ''
    company_logo: 
    location: Xi’ an Jiaotong University, China
    date_start: '2021-07-01'
    date_end: '2021-08-01'
    description: |2-
        Responsibilities include:
        
        * Designed a kind of passive filter capable of adjusting cutoff frequency and passband range (1Hz, 100Hz and 1000Hz).
        * Used the required components to weld the circuit according to the designed and simulated circuit diagram. (Three same multifunctional passive filters have been successfully fabricated and the performance is good.)
        * Presented individual research report entitled “Multifunctional Passive Filter” in group meeting.
        * Learned laboratory operations of 2D quantum materials and devices, prepared two-dimensional materials (graphene and hNB) with tapes, combined them into hNB-graphene-hNB structures under high power microscopy, and tested the properties of samples.
